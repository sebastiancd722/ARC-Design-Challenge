ARC Design Challenge — Athlete Profile Sections

Created for the Powered By ARC UI / Section Designer Shortlist Task

Overview

This repository contains my submission for the ARC UI / Section Designer challenge.
The task required building two modular website sections using Tailwind CSS:

Hero Section (Mandatory)

Stats Section (My Selection)

Both sections follow ARC’s design philosophy: clean spacing, layered depth, mobile-first structure, and reusable modular blocks. The content is themed around a fictional U18 prep basketball athlete.

Features

Fully responsive Tailwind-built layouts

Accessible focus states on all interactive elements

Smooth metric animations using a lightweight JavaScript counter

Slight parameterization for easier stat reuse (PLAYER config block)

Drop-in ready structure for ARC-style section libraries

High-quality image integration with dark gradient overlay

File Structure
├── index.html       # Full implementation of both sections
├── basketball.jpg   # Athlete image used in the hero layout
└── README.md

Tech Stack

HTML5

Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

Notes

This build focuses on clarity, modularity, and readability.
All values, images, and copy are placeholders and can be swapped for real athlete data during integration.
